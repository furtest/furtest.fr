The Spooky CTF is organised by NICC, NJIT's information & cybersecurity club.   
You can check them out on [njiticc.com](https://njiticc.com/).  

I mostly did bin (pwn and reverse) challenges as I started the CTF quite late.  
On this site I separated the challenges in pwn and reverse categories but during the ctf both were mixed together.  
In addition to the writeups below I also solved the web challenge Paranormal picture but didn't make a writeup for it.
