## Intro

Name: wont-somebody-think-of-the-children   
Description: If Loab is back, we might need the council to help us out. The problem is that Anna sent Maya looking for them but she still hasn't come back. This is her last known location... Maybe you can help find her.  
I'd go, but I really don't want to be around those spooky ghost orphans.

## Solve

We get a really large svg, after fiddling around a bit I open it with Inkscape and find that some layers have names that are different than the others.
So I disable every other layer and find the flag.
Both files are available (the one with every layer and the one with the flag).

![Original](yeoldeorphanarium.svg)

![Solved (some layer disabled)](./solved.svg)

The flag is : `NICC{H3ck_th3m_kids_what_@bout_the_council?}`
