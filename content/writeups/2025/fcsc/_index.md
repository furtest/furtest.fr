FCSC is the France Cyber Security Challenge organised by [ANSSI](https://cyber.gouv.fr/) (agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d'information) in order to create the French team for [ECSC](https://ecsc.eu/) (european cyber security challenge).   
I have been participating casually for the last 2 years but this year I invested a reasonable amount of time into it. Not as much as I would have wanted to due to classes but I still managed to rank 310th in the general ranking and 27th in the junior ranking with 1381 points which is pretty good.  

I solved 21 challenges some of them have writeups some not. Some of them where part of the intro category which consist of easier challenges of various categories they are marked with `(intro)` after the name.
